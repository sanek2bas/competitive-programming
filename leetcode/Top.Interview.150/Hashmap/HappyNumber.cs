    /// A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
    /// Starting with any positive integer, replace the number
    /// by the sum of the squares of its digits.
    /// Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
    /// or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
    /// Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
    /// Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.
