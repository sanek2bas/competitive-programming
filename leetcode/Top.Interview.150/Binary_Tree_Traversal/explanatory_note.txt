Binary Tree Traversal involves visiting all the nodes in a binary tree in a specific order.

PreOrder: root -> left -> right

InOrder: left -> root -> right

PostOrder: left -> right -> root

Sample Problem:
Problem Statement: Perform inorder traversal of a binary tree.

Example:

Input: root = [1, null, 2, 3]

Output: [1, 3, 2]

Explanation:
1. Inorder traversal visits nodes in the order: left, root, right.
2. Use recursion or a stack to traverse the tree in this order.
