    /// Roman numerals are represented by seven
    /// different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
    /// Symbol Value
    /// I - 1
    /// V - 5
    /// X - 10
    /// L - 50
    /// C - 100
    /// D - 500
    /// M - 1000
    /// For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, 
    /// just two one's added together.
    /// 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. 
    /// The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
    /// Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest 
    /// from left to right.However, the numeral for four is not IIII. 
    /// Instead, the number four is written as IV.Because 
    /// the one is before the five we subtract it making four. 
    /// The same principle applies to the number nine, 
    /// which is written as IX.
    /// There are six instances where subtraction is used:
    /// I can be placed before V (5) and X(10) to make 4 and 9. 
    /// X can be placed before L(50) and C(100) to make 40 and 90. 
    /// C can be placed before D(500) and M(1000) to make 400 and 900.
    /// Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.
