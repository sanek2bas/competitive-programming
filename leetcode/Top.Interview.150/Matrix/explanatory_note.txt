Matrix involves traversing elements in a matrix 
using different techniques (DFS, BFS, etc.).

Use this pattern for problems involving traversing 2D grids 
or matrices horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

Sample Problem:
Perform flood fill on a 2D grid. Change all the cells connected to the starting cell to new color.

Example:

Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2

Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

Explanation:
1. Use DFS or BFS to traverse the matrix starting from the given cell.
2. Change the color of the connected cells to the new color.
