Backtracking explores all possible solutions and backtracks when a solution path fails.

Use this pattern when you need to find all (or some) solutions to a 
problem that satisfies given constraints. For example: combinatorial problems, 
such as generating permutations, combinations, or subsets.

Sample Problem:
Generate all permutations of a given list of numbers.

Example:

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]

Output: [[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]

Explanation:
1. Use recursion to generate permutations.
2. For each element, include it in the current permutation and 
   recursively generate the remaining permutations.
3. Backtrack when all permutations for a given path are generated.
