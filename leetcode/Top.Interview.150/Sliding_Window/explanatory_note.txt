The Sliding Window pattern is used to find a subarray or substring that satisfies 
a specific condition, optimizing the time complexity by maintaining a window of elements.

Use this pattern when dealing with problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.

Sample Problem:
Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.

Example:

Input: nums = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3

Output: 9

Explanation:
1. Start with the sum of the first k elements.
2. Slide the window one element at a time, subtracting the element that goes out 
   of the window and adding the new element.
3. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.
