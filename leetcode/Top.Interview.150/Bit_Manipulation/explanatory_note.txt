Bit Manipulation is a technique used in a variety of problems to get the solution 
in an optimized way. This technique is very effective from a 
Competitive Programming point of view. It is all about Bitwise Operators 
which directly works upon binary numbers or bits of numbers that help the 
implementation fast. Below are the Bitwise Operators that are used:
- bitwise AND (&)
- bitwise OR (|)
- bitwise XOR (^)
- bitwise NOT (!)

All data in computer programs are internally stored as bits, i.e., as numbers 0 and 1.

Examples:

1. Check if a number is even or odd
We can use the AND operator to check if a number is even or odd. The least 
significant bit of an even number is always 0, while for an odd number, it’s 1.

bool isEven(int n) {
    return (n & 1) == 0;
}

bool isOdd(int n) {
    return (n & 1) == 1;
}

2. Check if the i-th bit is set

bool isBitSet(int n, int i) {
    return (n & (1 << i)) != 0;
}

3. Set the i-th bit
To set the i-th bit of a number to 1, we can use the OR operator with a mask 
created using the left shift operator.

int setBit(int n, int i) {
    return n | (1 << i);
}

4. Clear the i-th bit
To clear (set to 0) the i-th bit of a number, we can use the AND operator with
 the complement of a mask created using the left shift operator.

int clearBit(int n, int i) {
    return n & ~(1 << i);
}

5. Toggle the i-th bit
To toggle (flip) the i-th bit of a number, we can use the XOR operator with 
a mask created using the left shift operator.

int toggleBit(int n, int i) {
    return n ^ (1 << i);
}

6. Count the number of set bits
Counting the number of set bits (1s) in a number is a common problem. 
Here’s an efficient method known as Brian Kernighan’s algorithm:

int countSetBits(int n) {
    int count = 0;
    while (n) {
        n &= (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    return count;
}
