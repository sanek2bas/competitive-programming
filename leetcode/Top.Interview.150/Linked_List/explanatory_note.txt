The In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern reverses parts 
of a linked list without using extra space.

Use this pattern when you need to reverse sections of a linked list.

Sample Problem:
Reverse a sublist of a linked list from position m to n.

Example:

Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], m = 2, n = 4

Output: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]

Explanation:
1. Identify the start and end of the sublist.
2. Reverse the nodes in place by adjusting the pointers.
