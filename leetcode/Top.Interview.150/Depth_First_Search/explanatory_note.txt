Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal technique that explores as far down 
a branch as possible before backtracking.

Use this pattern for exploring all paths or branches in graphs or trees.

Sample Problem:
Find all paths from the root to leaves in a binary tree.

Example:

Input: root = [1, 2, 3, null, 5]

Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

Explanation:
1. Use recursion or a stack to traverse each path from the root to the leaves.
2. Record each path as you traverse.
