Dynamic Programming (DP) involves breaking down problems into smaller subproblems 
and solving them using a bottom-up or top-down approach.

Use this pattern for problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.

DP itself has multiple sub-patterns. Some of the most important ones are:
- Fibonacci Numbers
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
- Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
- Subset Sum
- Matrix Chain Multiplication

Sample Problem:
Calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.

Example:

Input: n = 5

Output: 5 (The first five Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5)

Explanation:
1. Use a bottom-up approach to calculate the n-th Fibonacci number.
2. Start with the first two numbers (0 and 1) and iterate to 
   calculate the next numbers like (dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]).
