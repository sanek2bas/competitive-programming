Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a traversal technique that explores 
nodes level by level in a tree or graph.

Use this pattern for finding the shortest paths in unweighted graphs or level-order traversal in trees.

Sample Problem:
Perform level-order traversal of a binary tree.

Example:

Input: root = [3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]

Output: [[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]

Explanation:
1. Use a queue to keep track of nodes at each level.
2. Traverse each level and add the children of the current nodes to the queue.
